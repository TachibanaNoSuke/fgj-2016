## Introduction

FGJ 2016 project, see [FGJ wiki](http://fgj.igda.jp/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=team:taipeiiii_a) for detail.

Change an angle, change the distance, you can solve the problem!

## Concept

Change the distance between character and background, it looks like the background size and direction change, and you can let the character can go to the goal.

## How to play

The character auto move to right.
Drag the slide bar to change the size and position. Use the feature to solve the puzzles!!
